      <p>
        I'm a Director of Technology at a Midwest MSP, reporting to the executive team. I direct technology strategy
        and delivery, lead service desk and automation teams, and translate business goals into automation, compliance,
        and security outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've built and maintained documentation libraries with over 2,500 artifacts, created onboarding playbooks, and
        established processes that reduce manual engineer effort across service desks. I focus on blending people,
        process, and tooling so teams operate with confidence.
