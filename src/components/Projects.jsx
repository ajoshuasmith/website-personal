      <p>I've migrated multiple organizations from legacy Active Directory to cloud-first environments, achieving secure
        score targets above 750 and enabling remote work readiness. I've directed cross-platform hypervisor migrations
        between VMware, Hyper-V, and open-source stacks with minimal downtime.</p>
      <p>I built a documentation-backed process library with over 2,500 artifacts and an automation backlog that
        reduced manual engineer effort across service desks. I've implemented Apple device management platforms,
        designed processes around device lifecycle, and managed Docker container deployments.</p>
